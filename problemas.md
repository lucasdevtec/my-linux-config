#Pomodoro
Sorry to hear you experienced this issue... If you prefer not compiling it on your system, you may download the source code for 0.22.1 https://github.com/gnome-po... and copy files from plugins/gnome/extension to /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/pomodoro@arun.codito.in/ . Files config.js and metadata.json need to be preserved. I'm working on providing a Flatpak, so updates will be easier in the future.
